Hi there 👋 I'm **Anıl Duman**, **Master’s in Software Engineering** in Germany. During my thesis, I'm developing a **CNN-based framework for wildlife monitoring**, using transfer learning and anomaly detection to classify species, analyze their behavior over time, and support conservation efforts. 

My journey started in electrical engineering and led me through diverse fields like electrochemical technologies, aviation, and even archaeology, which shaped the way I approach complex problems. Along the way, I also worked as an electrical engineer in industrial environments, gaining hands-on experience with automation systems and maintenance projects. 

I’m passionate about building **AI systems that have real-world impact**, especially in areas like sustainability, nature conservation, and scientific discovery. 

Beyond the world of code and research, I hold a strong love for history and art, the timeless sources of inspiration that fuel my creativity. 🎨📜
